I have modified it slightly, to try and clean up some of the code. I intend
to make the various "settings" at the top of hudchat.lua into actual settings
that can be configured in-game, by making use of the BLT hook's menu system.

If the original owners of the code (Ahab or Seven) wish to claim ownership,
I will gladly hand over control of the repository, on the condition that it
remain on GitHub or another public code hosting platform, to allow the
community to more easily contribute to the mod.
